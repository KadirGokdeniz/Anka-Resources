;revert the hexadecimal digits of a word stored in ax
;given 0xabcd, we need to get 0xdcba
;note that we cannot simply rotate the number to left or right 16 times
;since this would give the original number.

revert proc    
       ; we need to swap the most significant byte with the least significant byte
